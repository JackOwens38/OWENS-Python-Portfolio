# Tidy Data Project

#### Tidy Data allows users to manipulate and summarize data efficiently and effectively, and is an essential practice to become familiar with if you intend to dive into the world of data analysis. Considering that, I modified a wide-form dataset I received to adhere to principles of tidy data. During the process, not only did I learn a lot about the benefits of tidy data, but I also gained more experience practicing exploratory data analysis, including data cleansing and data visualization. 

## [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/JackOwens38/OWENS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy_data_project)
### Tidy Data Project on 2008 Olympic Medalists
#### The dataset for my tidy data project can by found under the data folder of this repository

### How to access my work
#### To access my project, you will need to download the Jupyter Notebook "main.ipynb" from this repository, which will include all of the code needed. Additionally, you will need to download the dataset mentioned above. The program also contains methods from pandas, seaborn, and matplot. 

#### The Jupyter Notebook is arranged such that markdowns provide organization throughout the code. From there, you can see the steps taken, including adjusting the data to long-form and creating visualizations. 
#### This is a portion of what the data looked like after being converted to long-form:
