# Tidy Data Project

#### Tidy Data allows users to manipulate and summarize data efficiently and effectively, and is an essential practice to become familiar with if you intend to dive into the world of data analysis. Considering that, I modified a wide-form dataset I received to adhere to principles of tidy data. During the process, not only did I learn a lot about the benefits of tidy data, but I also gained more experience practicing exploratory data analysis, including data cleansing and data visualization.
