# Welcome to my Python Portfolio!

## This repository will be used to store all of my Python projects, including EDA, visualizations, and models!

## [Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/JackOwens38/OWENS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app):

### Ever wonder which tourist attraction is best for you to visit? I developed a streamlit app that allows you to analyze and filter through reviews of some of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. This project taught me many of the basics of creating streamlit apps, and helped me understand their capabilities. 

## [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/JackOwens38/OWENS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy_data_project):

### Winning Olympic gold sounds cool and all--but have you ever created a tidy dataset? In this project, I turned a wide-form dataset featuring the athletes who won medals in the 2008 Olympics into a tidy dataset, before conducting some basic exploraty data analysis on it. This project taught me the importance of tidy data in general, but also showed me the process of how to make the data tidy. it also gave me more experience cleaning data, building visualizations, and more.

## [Named Entity Recognition App](https://github.com/JackOwens38/OWENS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp):

### Need to identify some key words in a long series of text? This app uses the spaCy library to analyze and identify key entities in custom uner-inputted texts. Additionally, users can input their own custom labels and patterns. This project introduced me to the basics of Natural Language Processing, specifically the Named Entity Recognition component of it. Getting even more familiar with both spaCy and Streamlit also helped me become more comfortable with very popular Python libraries, which I hope to continue to do.

## [Summer 2025 Cycling Tracker App](https://github.com/JackOwens38/OWENS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)

### Follow along with my journey! This summer, I will be completing a cross-country bike ride to raise funds and awareness for lung cancer patients and their families. The ride will take me from San Francisco to South Jersey, including a stop at Notre Dame. Use this app to follow along with my journey and learn more about the fight against lung cancer. This project taught me a lot about manipulating a dataset, specifically pulling a lot of data from a specific row at one time. Moreover it helped me continue to get comfortable with Streamlit and its capabilities, and it helped me to market for a cause that means a lot to me.
