# Welcome to my Python Portfolio!

## This repository will be used to store all of my Python projects, including EDA, visualizations, and models!

### Ever wonder which tourist attraction is best for you to visit? I developed a streamlit app that allows you to analyze and filter through reviews of some of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. This project taught me many of the basics of creating streamlit apps, and helped me understand their capabilities. 

## [Tidy Data Project](https://github.com/JackOwens38/OWENS-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/tidy_data_project):

### Winning Olympic gold sounds cool and all--but have you ever created a tidy dataset? In this project, I turned a wide-form dataset featuring the athletes who won medals in the 2008 Olympics into a tidy dataset, before conducting some basic exploraty data analysis on it. This project taught me the importance of tidy data in general, but also showed me the process of how to make the data tidy. it also gave me more experience cleaning data, building visualizations, and more.
